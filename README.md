### Things to know

I have used puppeteer package to scrap books pages.

- The pages of the Fairy Tales are real pages.
- The pages of the other books are the same.

I couldn't find real pages for the not fairy tales books so i just scraped random chapter

of a book and added it to the pages just to fill them.
